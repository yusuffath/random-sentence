# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Deploying to Vercel

You can easily deploy this Next.js application to Vercel. Here's how:

### Step 1: Set up a Vercel Account

If you don't have a Vercel account, sign up for free at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup).

### Step 2: Install the Vercel CLI

Open your terminal and install the Vercel Command Line Interface (CLI) globally. This tool allows you to deploy your project from your local machine.

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### Step 3: Log in to Vercel from the CLI

Log in to your Vercel account. This will link your local machine to your Vercel account.

```bash
vercel login
```

### Step 4: Deploy Your Project

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
vercel
```

The Vercel CLI will guide you through the rest of the process. It will automatically detect that you're deploying a Next.js project and configure the build settings for you. Once the deployment is complete, you'll get a public URL for your live application.
